A possible project of interest would be based on the open source project I described in the previous lab, where block-based coding is implemented.  By replacing actual syntax with blocks, you can allow for simple programs to be made with popular coding structures while simulaneously eliminating nearly all syntax errors in a program.  This environment would benefit children, who would be able to learn to code in a more visual environment.  To organize this project, since the initial project team would likely be small a common repository would be beneficial simply for ease of use, but a larger team with less communication between all members would benefit more from a blessed repository where someone is able to control the changes to the master branch.
